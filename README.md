## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Development

#### The Project Contains Four Files :

#### css /

- styles.css

####  index.html

#### js /

- app.js

####  README.md

- In CSS Style there is a lot of change done on the project to be the style you see on screen interface right now, also a lot of modifications to be responsive on all screen types.

  

- There's not a lot of modification done in the HTML File it was just adding 2 more sections (4 and 5) to the Page.



 The majority of the work was done on app.js.
